# Electronics
Educational etudes related to electronics, schematics, PCB layout, etc.

Fairly random collection of designs related to my hobbies, with backup in hidden agenda.
Historic items are in PCB123 (private vendor-specific, incompatible with anything else); more recent work is KiCad and LtSpice.
